# Introducing Misual

In a previous article, I created a visualization of the collatz conjecture using HTML5 canvas. However, I realized that this visualization could be applied to many different series and conjectures in the field of mathematics. This led me to create and publish my first npm module which I'm calling Misual.

Misual (**M**ath + Visual) is a small library for visualizing mathematical functions. It takes a function as input and draws a bar chart as well as various randomness analysis visuals such as a line of best fit and a rolling average.

I've used misual and inputed several functions for various mathematical conjectures and series that you can check out below.
