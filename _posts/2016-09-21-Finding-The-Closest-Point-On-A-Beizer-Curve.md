# Finding The Closest Point On A Beizer Curve

I recently came across the need to find the point on a quadratic Beizer Curve closest to some other point. I couldn't find a solution online that matched my specific requirements so I wrote a small class in JavaScript to do it. You can see it demonstrated in the below interactive.

You can see the class below.
