# An IoT Dog Pen

How cool is the internet of things? It has the oppurtunity to make our lives easier by doing everything from a smart fridge telling us when we're out of milk and sending a notification to our phone to cars emailing us when we need an oil change. I recently spent a weekend playing around with the revolutionary idea of machines connected to the internet and I created a smart pen for my dog, "minion".

## The actual pen

Before I can make the pen smart, I have to make a pen. Minion's a small dog so the idea was to make a medium-sized pen I could fit in the flower garden so it didn't have to be moved to cut the grass. I also had the idea to put it up against the basement window so minion could jump through the window whenever he wanted to go outside.
