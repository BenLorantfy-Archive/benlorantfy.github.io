# An IoT Dog Pen

How cool is the internet of things? It has the oppurtunity to make our lives easier by doing everything from a smart fridge telling us when we're out of milk and sending a notification to our phone to cars emailing us when we need an oil change. I recently spent a weekend playing around with the revolutionary idea of machines connected to the internet and I created a smart pen for my dog, "minion".

## The actual pen

Before I can make the pen smart, I have to make a pen. Minion's a small dog so the idea was to make a medium-sized pen I could fit in the flower garden so it didn't have to be moved to cut the grass. I also had the idea to put it up against the basement window so minion could jump through the window whenever he wanted to go outside.

I cleared out a 8' x 3' space in the weed ridden graden in my backyard. I created a 3-sided frame out of 2x4 with the thought that the 4th side would be the house. I then wrapped chicken wire around the 3 sides and stapeled it to the 2x4s. I dug a little trench for the bottom 2x4s and covered them up so it would be harder for minion to dig under the pen if he tried. I also filled the bottom of the pen with wood chips so minion wouldn't drag in mud.

Next I made the door of the pen. The idea was to have it fit where the screen ussually fits so the window could still close when it rains, snows, etc. Or we could also close it if we didn't want minion outside for whatever reason.
